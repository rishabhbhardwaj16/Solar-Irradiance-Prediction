# Solar-Irradiance-Prediction
The solar radiation received at ground level, known as global radiation, undergoes different processes of absorption, dispersion or scattering in the atmosphere that result in lower levels of solar radiation being received at the Earth's surface. These are due to the atmosphere components, such as ozone or CO2, and solid and liquid particles in suspension like aerosols or water vapor. However, the main source of attenuation is the cloud cover. 
While we may appreciate the capacity of solar panels and solar batteries, many of us don’t understand how much energy a solar panel produces.

Solar radiation is ultimately what directly brings two essential conditions that are needed to maintain life on Earth: light and heat. Light is obviously what is most directly needed by photosynthesis to absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.
